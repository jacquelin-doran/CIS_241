This is a Glossary for the commands learned in CIS 241

\\\ 
In home directory, typing ls then enter will show me my files and directorys, like CIS_241
\\\

\\\
In my main directory, typing pwd will show me /home/jimenjac

\\\
When I am in /home/woodriir/cis_241 and I type cd, I will go to /home/jimenjac
\\\

**mkdir** - make a directory, this will create a new directory
\\\
When I typed mkdir cis_241_jimenez it created a directory in my home directory
\\\

**man** - reference manuals, this shows the manual behind other commands and the flags assoicated with them
\\\
Whe I type man ls, I am taken to a file that shows all the flags, like -a -l that can be added to the ls
command and their meanings
\\\

**cat** - concatenate, this shows a file in a standard output format
\\\
If I cat this file, Glossary.md I should see all of these commands in a standard written format.
\\\

**vim** - a text editor, this command opens an editor in linux that allows for editing of files
\\\
If I vim a file, md txt awk, just about anything, I will be able to type and create content in that file, like this one.
\\\

**cp** - copy command, this will copy files from one directory to another
\\\
When I cp <file> to /directory/ it will move there. I can also give the copied file a new name via /directory/newname.txt
\\\

**mv** - move command, this moves a file to a new directory
\\\
If I mv file to /directory/filenew I will be moving and renaming that file. The difference from copy is we are moving the original
file in this instance, instead of making a copy.
\\

**rm** - remove, this is used to remove any file
\\\
If I were to rm this file, it would be gone.
\\\

**touch** - touch, allows the creation of a new, blank file
\\\

\\\


**sort** - sort, a command that will sort a text file.
\\\
When sort is ran by itself, it will take the first letter of each line and sort that way. Many flags can be used, like -n to sort numerically,
to obtain different sort results.
\\\

**head** - head, used to view the first lines of a file
\\\
If I head this file, I would only see the first few commands listed.
\\\

**tail** - tail, used to view the last ten lines of a file
\\\
Opposite of head, if I tail this file, I will see the last lines and commands listed. 
\\\

**chmod** - change ownership, a command that, with flags, will allow certian permissions for different users on a system
\\\
There are 3 types of users, Owner, Group and Anyone else. We use O G and U to represent those. The permissions are read write and execute.
Their representations are r w and x. So if I wanted to give everyone permission to write this file, I would chmod -uw.
