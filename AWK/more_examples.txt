More AWK examples from class. These notes start on March 8th.

BEGIN{
	FS=","
	OFS=":"
	print "Looking for" country <-variable
	energy = 0
	energy2 = 0
}
	/Petajoules/ { <-a condition
	energy=energy+$5
}
	/Gigajoules/{
	energy2 = energy2 + $5 <- 5th feild
}
END{
	print "energy was" energy
	print "energy was" energy2
}
This example will calculate all the energy produced by a country
using a csv file we have with information in it. 
We run this for all and there are two types of energy in the file
therefore we have to have two different conditions.

BEGIN{
	FS= ","
}
{
	split($1,arr, "/")
	print arr[1],arr[2]
}
END{
}
This example is using a built in function in AWK called
split. We can use this when we want to split a single field.
We are using a date like 10/10/2020 and we want to split this. 
This whole date is housed in the first feild, so we use the split 
method and can get the day, month and year seperated from it.
