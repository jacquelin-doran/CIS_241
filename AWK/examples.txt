These are examples from class of different AWK files.
To make these work properly they should be put in a file .awk. 

BEGIN{
	FS=","
}

/CONDITION/ {
	print $2
}

END {

}

This example prints the second feild from a file that is comma seperated.
A condition inside the forward slashes would be an if,or type statement.
The example we used in class was /INDIA/ so only print the feild that is 
associated with /INDIA/ in the line.

BEGIN{
	FS = ","
	OFS= ":"
}
/CONDITION/ {

	print $1,$2,$3

}

END{
}

In this example we are taking the first three feilds from a file and
reformatting them with colons : as their seperator. Without the OFS
they will be output with the default feild seperator, whitespaces.

BEGIN{
	FS=","
	OFS=":"
	print "Looking for information for the country " country
}

$0 ~ country{ (see if the line contains our regular expression for the country)
	print $1,$2,$3
}

END{
}

This example is paired with the command 
awk -f sample.awk -v country=India energy.csv
With this command we pass in a variable that we defined in our script. 


BEGIN{
	FS=","
	OFS=":"
	print "Looking for" variable1
	variable2 = 0
}

$0 ~ variable1{
	variable2= variable2 + $5 (a field)
}

END{
print "Energy" variable2
}

In this example we are looking at our first variable as our condition. If the
line has our variable1, then we take our variable2 and add it to itself and 
the line's 5th feild. In this example we were using energy as our variable2 
and determined an overall energy consumption based on whatever contry we chose.
